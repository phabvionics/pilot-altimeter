# pilot-altimeter
Pressure-based altimeter for Android phones and tablets.

This is the source code for the Android altimeter and vertical speed indicator that used to be hosted on Google Play here:

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.phabvionics.pilotaltimeter&hl=en_GB

At the time of writing, the link still appears to be valid, but I have not updated the application to current Google Play
standards so it may not be possible to install it.

A good description of the app is here:

The author at the time of writing, and sole contributor to the code base, is David Thomas.

Note that he has since changed name and gender. She is now known as Robyn Thomas:

On 13th April 2016, the date on which I am writing this document, I decided to publish the source code and make it available
under the terms of the Apache 2.0 licence.

I don't have a great deal of time to devote to hobbyist programming right now, so I'm publishing this code in case anybody
else would like to make any contributions to it. While I'm not expecting that to happen, if it does help anybody in any way,
that would be great!

I pushed to this repository from Android Studio 2.0. Please let me know if it does not build because of a missing dependency
and I will endeavour to rectify that.
