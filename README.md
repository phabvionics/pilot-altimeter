A good description of the app is here:

The author at the time of writing, and sole contributor to the code base, is David Thomas:

On 13th April 2016, the date on which I am writing this document, I decided to publish the source code and make it available
under the terms of the Apache 2.0 licence.

I don't have a great deal of time to devote to hobbyist programming right now, so I'm publishing this code in case anybody
else would like to make any contributions to it. While I'm not expecting that to happen, if it does help anybody in any way,
that would be great!

I pushed to this repository from Android Studio 2.0. Please let me know if it does not build because of a missing dependency
and I will endeavour to rectify that.
